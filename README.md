# Bunix

**Bunix** is a Unix-like operating system developed entirely from scratch by a single developer.  
Focusing on **performance**, **stability**, and **security**, Bunix is an ambitious project to build a modern OS from the ground up.

> 🚧 Development may slow down occasionally due to school and personal life commitments.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Architecture Support**: Currently supports **i386** (32-bit).  
  Support for **x86_64** (64-bit) is planned for future releases.
  
- **Boot Method**: BIOS only (for now).  
  **UEFI** support is also planned, though it currently works with **UEFI CSM (Compatibility Support Module)**.
