Bunix all rights reserved.
--------------------------

Bunix is a Unix-Like Operating System Developed entirely from scratch by one person.
It focuses on perfomance stability and security.
Updates may slow down sometimes due to school and my personal life.

Processor supported currently is only i386 by now but x86_64 will be planned on to be added as well.
Only supports the BIOS currently UEFI will be planned on to be added as well.
Also works using UEFI CSM!
